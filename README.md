##Requirements:
__Language:__ python
__Module:__ kivymd, socket, os, threading.
##Summary:
This is just a starting prototype. In this all the server side and client-side code use write on own using sockets in python. And application design was done using kivyMd in python this is what we think as flow of our project. And now I think we must use flutter. In future the idea will come to live with new design and features in more elegant way.
